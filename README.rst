Usage
-----

To build and package a local Slicer source tree at `~/src/Slicer` against pre-built dependencies::

  docker run --name slicer slicer/slicer-dependencies
  # Copy the generated Slicer package to the /tmp/ directory.
  docker cp slicer:$(docker cp slicer:/usr/src/Slicer-build/Slicer-build/PACKAGE_FILE.txt - | tar xO) /tmp/
  docker rm slicer

Update
------

To update the Slicer revision, first download Slicer sources::

  git clone git://github.com/Slicer/Slicer

Then download SlicerDocker sources and check out a local branch for the update::

  git clone git://github.com/Slicer/SlicerDocker
  cd SlicerDocker
  git checkout -b update-$(date +%F)

And run the update script::

  ./slicer-base/update.sh /path/to/src/Slicer
